1. A Computer System is a collection of parts which include hardware, software, some type of data, and finally a user.
2. Some parts of the computer system are gates and circuits, microcode, the operating system, and assembly code.
3. In a compiled language the code is translated into machine code before it is executed while as in an interpreted language the code is executed line by line.
4. Yes C is a compiled language.
5. C was invented by Dennis Ritchie.
6. C has been in use for around 53 years.
7. Yes because a compiler translates the source code into machine code in order for the computer to read it.
8. Yes an assembler translates assembly code into machine code.
9. ls
10. atof() converts a string into its numerical value w3schools.com.
11. The lowest level 0 is the digital logic layer that consists of circuits and gates which allows the machine to process simple True and False problems and returns a 1 or a 0, level 1 is the Control layer which consisted of microcode which converts machine code in order for it to be processed by the CPU through the circuits and gates.
12. Fetch, Decode, Execute.
13. The ALU is what executes what is decoded and this can do anything from + and - to and/or operations.
14. extremely fast, small memory units built directly into the CPU that hold data and instructions for immediate use during processing https://www.totalphase.com. 
15. Application software is made to be used by people meanwhile System software is written to be executed by computers.
16. No cmp, rdi, and rsi is assembly language.
17. There are 3 buses.
